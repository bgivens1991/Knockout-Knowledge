# Knockout-Knowledge

This was a class project; we chose to create a game that was both fun but also educational.  We had a little over 3 months to put this game together for the class, but we do intend to build onto this game with more majors, more attacks and updated art.  Knock Out Knowledge is an 8-bit(ish) educational side-scrolling beat ‘em up video game. While the journey to the Bachelor’s Degree can seem like a fight, in this game to receive the degree, you will have to fight for it. You play as a college student who has to work his way through four years (levels) of college, each year concluding with a boss battle of educational proportions.  This is the script that the team put together to make this game work, including character dialogue, movement and attacks.  In the included link is all the art animation for the game and images for levels, objects and projectiles.
